      "long_caption": "26 August 2004Eastern Arabia Terra shares many attributes with western Arabia and Sinus Meridiani. In particular, it is a region of vast layered rock within which are interbedded filled and buried craters and valleys. Erosion has subsequently re-exposed many of these landforms, including the exhumed and eroded crater shown in this Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) image. Following the period in which erosion occurred, the region was blanketed by dust. This image is located near 22.5°N, 318.4°W, and covers an area about 3 km (1.9 mi) across. Sunlight illuminates the scene from the left/lower left.",
