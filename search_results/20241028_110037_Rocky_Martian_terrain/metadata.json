      "long_caption": "Figure AAnnotated ImageFigure BAnnotated ImageNo AnnotationFigure CAnnotated ImageNo AnnotationThe Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) captured two examples of gullies on crater walls in which a change occurred between 1999 and 2005. In each case, one in Terra Sirenum (see PIA09027 or MOC2-1618), the other in the Centauri Montes (see PIA09028 or MOC2-1619), new light-toned material was deposited during the MGS mission. These new light-toned deposits may be indicators that water flowed at these two gully sites during the past few years. Naturally, a question arises: are there other gullies at which similar light-toned deposits have formed?To answer the question, the MOC team at Malin Space Science Systems (MSSS) reviewed every MOC image ever taken of a martian gully. Most of the gullies occur at middle latitudes in both the northern and southern hemispheres. This re-examination turned up several good examples of other light-toned materials deposited in gullies. However, in none of these cases is there a \"before\" image, with no light-toned material, followed by an \"after\" image in which new light-toned material had appeared. Thus, one cannot know how long ago these other light-toned deposits formed. However, these are excellent candidates for future monitoring with orbiter cameras that have sufficient spatial resolution to look for new light-toned deposits, should they form during the coming years. Shown here are three of the best examples the MOC team identified. Figure A: This image shows several gullies with light-toned material on their floors and deposited in their aprons. This area is located on the northeast wall of Hale Crater near 35.5°S, 35.4°W. The picture is a mosaic of MOC images R07-02277 (acquired 31 July 2003), R13-01791 (acquired 11 January 2004), and S16-01780 (acquired 21 March 2006). The 500 meter scale bar is 547 yards long. Figure B: This image shows a portion of the south wall of an unnamed crater on the northern plains of Mars, near 59.0°N, 277.7°W. As in the previous example, the material deposited after movement through the gully channel is light-toned. A portion of another gully is seen on the left edge of the picture. This is a sub-frame of MOC image R01-00902, acquired on 19 January 2003. Figure C: This picture is a mosaic of MOC images M11-00286 (acquired 2 January 2000), S13-01274 (acquired 13 December 2005), and R09-01804 (acquired 16 September 2003). The arrows point to several light-toned gully deposits that were observed at this location, the wall of a deep pit formed in a large crater nearly filled with layered, boulder-producing rock. These features are located in Noachis Terra near 47.2°S, 355.8°W.

Bright surfaces are warmer than dark surfaces; the floor of the chasma is warmer than the plains at the top of the frame. Nighttime infrared images are extremely helpful in identifying bedrock outcrops, which stay warmer than dust covered surfaces. The landslide is also easy to identify in this image.Image information: IR instrument.

An empirical correction has been performed to remove instrumental effects. A linear shift has been applied in the cross-track and down-track direction to approximate spacecraft and planetary motion. Fully calibrated and geometrically projected images will be released through the Planetary Data System in accordance with Project policies at a later time.NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory manages the 2001 Mars Odyssey mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.

      "long_caption": "13 December 2004This Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) image shows fine details among mid-latitude gullies formed on the walls of a large pit within a filled meteor impact crater in the Noachis Terra region of Mars. Like the gullies originally described in June 2000, these may have formed by the seepage of groundwater. Other scientists have speculated that, elsewhere on Mars, similar gullies might form by melting of ice or snow, by liquid or gaseous carbon dioxide, or dry mass movement (landsliding) processes. The many fine tributaries in the Noachis pit crater area shown here lend support to the hypothesis that a liquid with the physical properties of water was involved. This image is located near 47.8°S, 354.9°W, and covers an area approximately 3 km (1.9 mi) wide. The scene is illuminated by sunlight from the upper left.",

The rocks in this August 2005 image were once below the ground and flat-lying. Now they are tilted on edge-a product of the impact that formed Oudemans Crater. Their regular layering and light tone suggest these might be ancient sedimentary rocks.Location near: 10.0°S, 92.1°W Image width: width: ~3 km (~1.9 mi) Illumination from: lower left Season: Southern Spring",

      "short_caption": "Landscape Northeast of Halley Crater",
      "long_caption": "This image shows a landscape west of Mars' Argyre impact basin and northeast of Halley Crater. The large but faint circular feature near the center of the image is an unnamed impact crater about 7.5 kilometers (4.7 miles) in diameter. It has been all but erased by geological (and probably ice-related) processes. In fact, the majority of impact craters in this image have been modified from their original shapes, some undoubtedly beyond recognition. Only a few small craters remain pristine. The most prevalent surface type in this image is rough, dissected terrain, which is characterized by a complex pattern of knobs, pits, ridges and valleys. In places the rough terrain has been covered by a younger material that appears flat, smooth and nearly featureless. The smooth material may have been emplaced as muddy or icy debris. It filled low-lying areas (most notably craters) and surrounded higher features, preserving islands of rough terrain. Wind-formed dunes have formed atop some of the smooth material, and diagonal streaks on the right side of the image may be due to the winds. Images such as this show the importance of water (liquid and/or ice), wind, and impacts in shaping the surface of Mars.This image was taken by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera onboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft on March 24, 2006. The image is centered at 47.14 degrees south latitude, 302.00 degrees east longitude. It is oriented such that north is 7 degrees to the left of up. The range to the target was 1,699 kilometers (1,056 miles). At this distance the image scale is 1.70 meter (5.58 feet) per pixel in the center portion of the image, so objects as small as 5.1 meter (16.7 feet) are resolved. In the side regions the pixels were binned 2x2 to a scale of 3.4 meters (11.2 feet) per pixel. The camera has a total of 10 red-bandpass CCD detectors, and in this image the first 4 CCDs on the left and the last 3 on the right were binned 2x2, while 3 in the middle returned data at full resolution. In total this image is 34.08 kilometers (21.18 miles) or 20,081 pixels wide and 8.50 kilometers (5.28 miles) or 5,164 pixels high. The image was taken at a local Mars time of 07:27 and the scene is illuminated from the upper right with a solar incidence angle of 84.5 degrees, thus the sun was about 5.5 degrees above the horizon. At an Ls of 29 degrees (with Ls an indicator of Mars' position in its orbit around the sun), the season on Mars is southern autumn.Images from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment and additional information about the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter are available online at: http://www.nasa.gov/mro or http://HiRISE.lpl.arizona.edu.
