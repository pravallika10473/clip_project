Both the dark fins and the paler outcrop beyond them hold potential targets for studying with instruments on the rover. Orbital investigation of the area has identified a possibility of clay minerals in this area of the Cape York segment of the western rim of Endeavour Crater. This view is toward the west. A portion of the rover's solar array is in the foreground. Winds cleaned some of the accumulated dust from the array in June and July 2012.",

      "long_caption": "Taken from Sojourner's forward camera, this image features a rover's-eye view of the Sagan Memorial Station. Areas of billowing airbags can be seen surrounding the lander, and the rear deployment ramp is seen at center. The rock Barnacle Bill is just to the right of the ramp, and Sojourner's tracks are shown leading away from the spacecraft. The lander's high-gain antenna is at the left of the lander's main electronics array, appearing as a small grey disc.Mars Pathfinder is the second in NASA's Discovery program of low-cost spacecraft with highly focused science goals. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, developed and manages the Mars Pathfinder mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C. JPL is an operating division of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). The Imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP) was developed by the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory under contract to JPL. Peter Smith is the Principal Investigator.",

      "long_caption": "This image is a traverse map, illustrating Spirit's path over the last 45 sols. When the rover reached the point called \"Laguna Hollow,\" it had driven 131 meters (430 feet) from Columbia Memorial Station. The rover heading is 45 degrees to the northeast. On the horizon behind the lander looms the landmark informally named \"Grissom Hill.\" Over the relatively flat traverse, Spirit has made observations of rocks such as \"Adirondack\" and utilized the tools on its arm to investigate soil in several locations. Spirit stayed at \"Laguna Hollow\" for 3 sols, dug a trench and observed the floor and wall of it with three of the instruments on its arm: the Moessbauer spectrometer, the alpha particle X-ray spectrometer and the microscopic imager. Spirit is about halfway to the edge of the crater dubbed \"Bonneville.\"",

      "long_caption": "This image is a screenshot from a computer-generated animation showing the path the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity traveled between the 16th and 21st days, or sols, of its mission. On sol 16, the rover followed a \"V-shaped\" route, driving backwards 2.5 meters (8.2 feet), turning in place 49 degrees counterclockwise, driving forward by 1 meter (3.3 feet), then driving forward again another 0.6 meters (2 feet). On sol 17, the rover traversed a \"U-shaped\" path, driving backwards 1.3 meters (4.3 feet), turning in place 90 degrees counterclockwise, driving forward 2.9 meters (9.5 feet), turning in place 90 degrees clockwise, driving forward 0.6 meters (2 feet), then finally driving forward again 0.5 meters (1.6 feet). On sol 19, the rover took another \"V-shaped\" journey, driving south backwards for approximately 1.9 meters (6.2 feet), turning in place to face the west-northwest rock target Zugspitze, then driving forward 2.5 meters (8.2 feet). On sol 21, the rover backed up 1.4 meters (4.6 meters), turned to the southwest, then via a series of arc turns, arrived at its trench location. Once there, the rover rotated 180 degrees to face 10 degrees to the west of north, then drove a short 0.5-meter-arc (1.6-foot-arc) forward. The drive ended with the rover facing approximately north, ready to dig a hole in the martian surface. Data from the rover's onboard sensors were used to make this animation.",

The tracks will be only a temporary scar on this martian landscape, as winds will eventually wipe them away.",
