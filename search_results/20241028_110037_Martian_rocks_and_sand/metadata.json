It is supported by NASA's Science Mission Directorate. NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley and NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, provided significant flight performance analysis and technical assistance during Ingenuity's development. AeroVironment Inc., Qualcomm, and SolAero also provided design assistance and major vehicle components. Lockheed Martin Space designed and manufactured the Mars Helicopter Delivery System.",

      "long_caption": "Annotated ImageClick on the image for larger versionThe right Mast Camera (Mastcam) of NASA's Curiosity Mars rover provided this view of the lower stratigraphy at \"Yellowknife Bay\" inside Gale Crater on Mars. The rectangle superimposed on the left image shows the location of the enlarged portion on the right. In the right image, white arrows point to veins (including some under the overhang), and black arrows point to concretions (small spherical concentrations of minerals). Both veins and concretions strongly suggest precipitation of minerals from water.The scale bar in the left image is 50 centimeters (19.7 inches) long. The scale bar in the right image is 10 centimeters (3.9 inches) long.Mastcam recorded this view in the morning of the 137th Martian day, or sol, of Curiosity's surface operations (Dec. 24, 2012). The image has been white-balanced to show what the rocks would look like if they were on Earth.",

      "short_caption": "Gully-like features found on the slopes of various craters, troughs, and other depressions are evident in this image taken by NASA's Mars Global Surveyor.",
      "long_caption": "Water is the chief agent of weathering and erosion on Earth. Mars is a much drier, colder planet on which liquid water cannot exist very long at the surface because it will immediately begin to boil, evaporate, and freeze--all at the same time. However, new pictures from the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) onboard the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) have provided an astonishing observation which suggests that liquid water may have played a role in shaping some recent gully-like features found on the slopes of various craters, troughs, and other depressions on the red planet.These pictures introduce the basic features of a martian gully. The figure on the left is an example from Mars, the figure on the right is a gully on Earth. In the Earth picture, rain water flowing under and seeping along the base of a recently-deposited volcanic ash layer has created the gully. For Mars, water is not actually seen but is inferred from the landforms and their similarity to examples on Earth.The landforms both on Earth and Mars are divided into three parts: the alcove, the channel, and the apron. Water seeps from between layers of rock on the wall of a cliff, crater, or other type of depression. The alcove forms above the site of seepage as water comes out of the ground and undermines the material from which it is seeping. The erosion of material at the site of seepage causes rock and debris on the slope above this area to collapse and slide downhill, creating the alcove.The channel forms from water and debris running down the slope from the seepage area. The point where the top of the channel meets the bottom of the alcove is, in many cases, the site where seepage is occurring. Channels are probably flushed-clean of debris from time to time by large flash floods of water released from behind an ice barrier that might form at the site of seepage during more quiescent times.The aprons are the down-slope deposits of ice and debris that were moved down the slope and through the channel. Whether any water--likely in the form of ice--persists in these deposits is unknown. The fact that the aprons do not go very far out onto the floors of craters and troughs (e.g., the foreground of the figure on the left) indicates that there is a limit as to how much water actually makes it to the bottom of the slope in liquid form. Most of the water by the time it reaches the bottom of the slope has probably either evaporated or frozen.The MOC image on the left was acquired July 3, 1999, and is located on the south-facing wall of an impact crater near 54.8°S, 342.5°W. The MOC image is illuminated from the upper left; north is toward the upper right. The MOC image covers an area 1.3 km (0.8 mi) wide by 2 km (1.2 mi) long. The pictures from the flank of the Mount St. Helens volcano in Washington (right; large image and inset) were taken by MGSMOC Principal Investigator, Michael C. Malin, in the 1980s after the eruptions of May 1980. They are illuminated from the left; note footprints on left side of the picture for scale, also note the colored bar, which is 30 cm (11.8 in) long.",

      "long_caption": "Released 12 April 2004The Odyssey spacecraft has completed a full Mars year of observations of the red planet. For the next several weeks the Image of the Day will look back over this first mars year. It will focus on four themes: 1) the poles - with the seasonal changes seen in the retreat and expansion of the caps; 2) craters - with a variety of morphologies relating to impact materials and later alteration, both infilling and exhumation; 3) channels - the clues to liquid surface flow; and 4) volcanic flow features. While some images have helped answer questions about the history of Mars, many have raised new questions that are still being investigated as Odyssey continues collecting data as it orbits Mars.This daytime VIS image was collected on December 14, 2002 during the southern winter season in Ganges Chasma.Image information: VIS instrument. Latitude -6.7, Longitude 310.8 East (49.2 West). 19 meter/pixel resolution.Note: this THEMIS visual image has not been radiometrically nor geometrically calibrated for this preliminary release. An empirical correction has been performed to remove instrumental effects. A linear shift has been applied in the cross-track and down-track direction to approximate spacecraft and planetary motion. Fully calibrated and geometrically projected images will be released through the Planetary Data System in accordance with Project policies at a later time.NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory manages the 2001 Mars Odyssey mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C. The Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) was developed by Arizona State University, Tempe, in collaboration with Raytheon Santa Barbara Remote Sensing. The THEMIS investigation is led by Dr. Philip Christensen at Arizona State University. Lockheed Martin Astronautics, Denver, is the prime contractor for the Odyssey project, and developed and built the orbiter. Mission operations are conducted jointly from Lockheed Martin and from JPL, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.",
